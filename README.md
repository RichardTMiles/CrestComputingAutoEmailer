# 📬 After School Email Scheduler

This was vibe coded with ChatGPT.

This utility automates rich weekly email drafts for afterschool robotics programs. It pulls from JSON-based class schedules and templated lessons, formats personalized messages with an inline logo, and drafts them in Apple Mail for manual review.

It also installs itself into cron for automated hourly checks and avoids re-sending duplicate emails.
